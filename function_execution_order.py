"""
The execution sequence of a function with user input involves two distinct stages:
1. Function Definition:
    a) When you define a function, you're essentially creating a blueprint for a set of instructions.
    b) This blueprint includes the function's name, parameters (arguments it can receive), 
    and the code that will be executed when the function is called.
    c) User input isn't involved at this stage. 
    The function definition simply establishes the structure and capabilities of the function.

2. Function Call and Execution:
    a) When you call the function, you provide it with specific values (arguments) that match its parameters.
    b) If the function has user input prompts within its code, these prompts appear during the function call.
      * The user interacts with the function by providing input values through these prompts.
      * The function then uses the provided arguments (including user input) to perform its calculations and return a result.


Here's a breakdown to illustrate the flow:

1. Function Definition:
def calculate_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

2. Function Call (Execution):
user_length = float(input("Enter the length: "))
user_width = float(input("Enter the width: "))

result = calculate_area(user_length, user_width)  # Function call with user input
print(f"The area is: {result}")


Execution Order:
1. The function definition (calculate_area) is encountered and stored in memory (blueprint).
2. The program continues execution after defining the function.
3. When the function is called (calculate_area(user_length, user_width)), the actual execution happens.
    * User input prompts appear (Enter the length..., Enter the width...).
    * The user interacts with the function by providing values.
    * The function uses these values (including user input) to calculate the area and returns the result.
    * The result is used or printed based on the context (print(f"The area is: {result}")).

Key Points:
1. User input prompts within the function's code are triggered during the function call, not the function definition.
2. The order of code blocks in the function definition doesn't necessarily reflect the execution order during a function call.
    User input prompts can appear anywhere within the function's code.
